<h1>Simple Mathematical Program</h1>
This program can be used to solve simple mathematical problems. It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. It can also solve linear equations, quadratic equations, and linear system equations.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To install the program, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can download the program from the following link:

https://github.com/MohamedRida19/calculator

<h2>Usage</h2>
To run the program, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the program. Then, type the following command:

python calc.py

The program will then prompt you to enter the numbers that you want to add, subtract, multiply, or divide. Once you have entered the numbers, the program will display the result.

To solve a quadratic equation, you would type the following command:

python calc.py eq_solver ax^2+bx+c=0

where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.

To solve a linear system equation, you would type the following command:

python calc.py system_solver a1x+b1y=c1 a2x+b2y=c2

where a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, and c2 are the coefficients of the system of equations.
